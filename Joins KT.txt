--Inner Join:
--Suppose you have two tables: Table A and Table B.
--You want to join these tables based on a common column, say "ID".
--INNER JOIN will return only the rows where the "ID" column in Table A matches the "ID" column in Table B.
-- Rows where there is no match between the "ID" columns will not be included in the result set.

--Left Join :

--You have two tables: Table A and Table B.
--You want to perform a LEFT JOIN on these tables based on a common column, say "ID".
--LEFT JOIN will return all the rows from Table A, regardless of whether there is a matching row in Table B or not.
--If there is a matching row in Table B, the columns from Table B will be included in the result set.
--If there is no match found in Table B for a row from Table A, the columns from Table B will contain NULL values in
-- result set.

-- Right join:


-- You have two tables: Table A and Table B.
-- You want to perform a RIGHT JOIN on these tables based on a common column, say "ID".
-- RIGHT JOIN will return all the rows from Table B, regardless of whether there is a matching row in Table A or not.
-- If there is a matching row in Table A, the columns from Table A will be included in the result set.
-- If there is no match found in Table A for a row from Table B, the columns from Table A will contain NULL values in
-- the result set.
